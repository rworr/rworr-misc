A Repository for any scripts I write that don't merit having a full repo to themselves.

Current contents:
project-euler-scripts: a collection of scripts to make my life easier when working
                       through project euler (also because I'm not putting my solutions
                       on github, so I wanted to write some stuff I could put on github)
    - project-euler-local-setup.py: a script which scrapes projecteuler.net, 
                       and constructs directories for each problem and language, 
                       and a doc directory containing problem descriptions
    - project-euler-run: a script which executes the given project euler solution 
                       in all languages from the root directory
